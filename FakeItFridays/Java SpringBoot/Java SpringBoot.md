Firsty ! This is a BIIIGGG one in terms of projects. 

# Set up for VSCode
This was simple just download the Springboot Extention pack 


# Gradel vs Maven build. 
let's chatGTP this 

**Gradle:**

1. **Build Language:** Gradle uses Groovy or Kotlin as its build language. This allows for a more expressive and concise build script compared to Maven's XML.
    
2. **Flexibility:** Gradle is often considered more flexible than Maven. It allows for scripting and supports incremental builds, making it more suitable for complex projects.
    
3. **Plugin System:** Gradle has a powerful plugin system that makes it easy to extend and customize the build process. There's a wide range of plugins available for various tasks.
    
4. **Performance:** Gradle is known for its performance improvements over Maven, especially in terms of build speed.
    
5. **Multi-project Builds:** Gradle has excellent support for multi-project builds, making it suitable for large and modular projects.
    

**Maven:**

1. **Build Language:** Maven uses XML for its build scripts. While XML is well-known and widely used, it can be more verbose compared to Gradle's Groovy or Kotlin.
    
2. **Convention over Configuration:** Maven follows the principle of "Convention over Configuration," which means that it has a predefined structure for projects, and developers need to follow certain conventions. This can be an advantage for standard projects but might be limiting for more complex or unconventional project structures.
    
3. **Dependency Management:** Maven has a strong and centralized dependency management system. It automatically downloads and manages project dependencies, making it easier to manage libraries and versions.
    
4. **Ease of Use:** Maven is often considered easier to set up and use, especially for simple projects. Its structure and conventions can be helpful for developers new to the build tool.
    
5. **Widely Adopted:** Maven has been around for longer and is more widely adopted in the Java ecosystem. Many projects and libraries use Maven, which can make it easier to integrate with existing systems.
    

**Advantages and Disadvantages:**

**Gradle:**

_Advantages:_

- More flexible and expressive build scripts.
- Excellent support for multi-project builds.
- Performance improvements over Maven.

_Disadvantages:_

- Learning curve, especially for developers not familiar with Groovy or Kotlin.
- Plugin ecosystem, while extensive, might not cover every possible use case.

**Maven:**

_Advantages:_

- Convention over Configuration makes it easy to set up.
- Widely adopted in the Java ecosystem.
- Strong and centralized dependency management.

_Disadvantages:_

- XML can be verbose and less expressive than Gradle's build scripts.
- Less flexibility compared to Gradle, especially for unconventional project structures.

In summary, the choice between Gradle and Maven often depends on the specific needs and preferences of the development team. Gradle is favored for its flexibility and performance, while Maven is known for its simplicity and widespread adoption.


# I swear we are about to stay on Web only stuff. 



## TODO : go over all the requests once again. 
just go over all the rest api put updated get post. 



## Tomcat. what is that ? 

Open sourced implementation of java Servelet or sering. 
manages WebSockits and stuff and ahs supprot for JavaBeans. we shall see 



| Command   | what it does | 
|-------------|-------------|
| ./gradlew bootRun | boots and runs the application | 
| ./gradlew build | Builds it | 
|./gradlew test | runs all test| 

yeah, wrote all this so i can remember the ./gradlew lmao ! XD 

basically intent -> response reaction
