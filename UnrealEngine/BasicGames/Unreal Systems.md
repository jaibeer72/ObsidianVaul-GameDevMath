### Explanation Like Iâ€™m 5:

Imagine you are playing with toy cars and other toys.

- **`UWorld`**: Think of this as the big playmat or table where you place all your toys. This big playmat is like the world for your toys. It's where all your toys live and can move around. It knows about all your toys and what they are doing.
