# CPU scheduling and processes.


The manager resolves conflicts to take a call. 
Deadlock management happens in an OS level. 

OS allows the User to communicate between computer and hardware nothing new here 

## Types of OS. 

| Uni  Programming | MultiProgramming| 
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Runs on a single program at at time| Runs on multiple progarms at once |
|  eg ATM Machine or single task ones | Run's multiple things like Windows| 

Preemptive and non-preemptive OS. 

- OS has multiple programs at the same time in memory, ready to be executed. 

Preemptive is when you have programs that allow 2 programs to use the CPU process for time periods. 

like eg P1 and P2 are 2 programers 

it will run P1(dt)->P2(dt)->P1(dt).. so on till P1 and P2 are done. 

so the rather than 
waitfor(p1) then run P2 which is non preemptive 
#CPU #Premptive #NonPreemptive
