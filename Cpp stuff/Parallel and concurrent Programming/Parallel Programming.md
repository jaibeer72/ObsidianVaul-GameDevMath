#SIMD #SingleInstructionMultipleData 
## SIMD  : single instruction multiple data 

#SISD single instruction single data 

this is a type of parallel computer with multiple cores or processes 
so we can do multiple in multi core. 


So if Data is Greater than the Different instructions. 

#MISD 
# Multiple Instruction single data 
so if i am transforming and also processing data at the same tim.. 

- why does this exist ? i don't even know. 

# MIMD: Multiple Instruction Multiple Data
#MIMD 

well , different things happening on differnt data. 
- Multicore programs or Network clusters
