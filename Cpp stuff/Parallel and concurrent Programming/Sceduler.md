# Ready Queue 
- This is a queue when the process is ready to queue up 
- The scheduler cycles through the processes and runs the processes based on the processor. 
	- If a process is waiting then it goes into the IO queue 
	- when the scedular decides to change the process from the ready queue its called a #contextSwitching 


the main idea is that not all the things are scheduled at the same time
