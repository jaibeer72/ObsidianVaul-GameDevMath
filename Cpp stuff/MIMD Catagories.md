# Single Program Multiple Data 
#SPMD #SingleProgramMultipleData

SPMD multple processing units are running copies of same program but different data. 
Different from #SIMD or #SingleInstructionMultipleData  is that it does not have to run the same counter for all the programs. On all the Processors. 

#SPMD runs Acyncronously #SingleProgramMultipleData 
#SIMD runs synchronously(like the counter is on the same place) but parallel #SingleInstructionMultipleData 

# Multiple Program Multiple data.
