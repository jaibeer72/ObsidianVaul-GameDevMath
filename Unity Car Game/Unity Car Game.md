## Game Setup

The game setup was easy. All that was needed to be done was set up the player play area. Put the cars in and ensure the textures are applied, then add them to the prefabs. 

Lastly, setting up the MainCamera to a viable position for gameplay. I like the more isometric view, so I placed it that way.
